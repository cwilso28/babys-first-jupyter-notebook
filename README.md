# my-first-jupyter-notebook
## Overview
This is my first Jupyter notebook shared through Github. I've had an unused Github account for a while and I've been practicing developing Jupyter notebooks. Why not combine the two and get familiar with both at the same time? This repo is my first step in uploading data files, organizing them, and then using them in a trial notebook.
